Proposal

After logging in faculty's roll, what you need to do is evaluate the project. While logging in we can see 
that there are student projects submitted for us to evaluate.
When we go to see the project, we will find various information from project and evaluate each topic. 
After that, we can change the project status. The project is currently being "evaluated".
Finally, let us evaluate whether to pass or not. If passed, send the project back to them. 
The students continue and the project status will be displayed as "approved", but if not passed Send the project back
Let the students make corrections. in order to resubmit it again and display the project status "not approved".
