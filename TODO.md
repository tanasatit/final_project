TODO

What I have to do It is to determine what duties in each roll must be done. 
The rolls will be divided into 3 categories: students, faculty, and admins.
1.students
A lead student can create a project,find members,send invitational messages to potential members,add members to the 
project and form a group,see and modify his own project details, send request messages to potential advisors, 
submit the final project report.
Member student can see and modify his project details.
2.Faculty
normal faculty see details of all the project and evaluate projects
advisors send accept or deny response for projects, see details of all project,evaluate projects, approve the project.
3.An admin can manage the database and update all the tables.
